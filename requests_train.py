# EXAMPLES ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION TRAINING:
# payload = {'nickname' : 'skater8', 'eMaiL': "trollingHardOnTheMoon@gg.gg"}
# payloads by get, note ? is added automatically:
# r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params = payload)
# print(r.url)

# JSON:
# r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
# pprint.pprint(r.json())

# r.raw for RAW SOCKET RESPONSE:
# r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events', stream = True)
# print(r.raw)
# print(r.raw.read(10))
# in general you should use a pattern like this to save what is being streamed to a file:
# with open('./file.txt', 'wb') as fd:
    # Response.iter_content will handle a lot of what you would otherwise
    # have to handle when using Response.raw directly.
    # for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=128):
    #     fd.write(chunk)
# An important note about using Response.iter_content versus Response.raw. Response.iter_content will automatically decode the gzip and deflate transfer-encodings. Response.raw is a raw stream of bytes â€“ it does not transform the response content. If you really need access to the bytes as they were returned, use Response.raw.

# CUSTOM HEADERS - some website will try to prevent our bots from reading, therefore use custom header:

# SENDING JSON, note: just parameter to encode payload as json:
