console_write -> waits for con_lock\n\nCPU 0x211\n  cpu_idle_p9 ->\n    prlog ->\n      console_write -> Takes con_lock lock\n       list_check_node -> tries to take stack_check_lock and hits deadlock.\n\nI think we don't need to hold `stack_check_lock` while printing\nbacktraces. Instead it makes sense to hold backtrace lock (bt_lock)\nand print output.\n\nReported-by: Cédric Le Goater <clg@kaod.org>\nSigned-off-by: Vasant Hegde <hegdevasant@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\nTested-by:
